## Fleet Command
- Played Ace Combat and Halo recently, kind of got motivated to try UI lockon systems, and just adding a really big ship with turrets on it, which was the main motivation behind the making of this prototype game.

-Since I was at it, it was interesting coming up with some kind of vocal dialogue system, so I had a couple of my friends provide some lines for me.
